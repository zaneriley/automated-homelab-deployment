# Subdomain Configuration

In this section, we'll dive into configuring subdomains for your homelab services using Terraform and Cloudflare. By defining subdomains and mapping them to the appropriate Cloudflare Tunnel UUIDs, you can easily access your services using user-friendly URLs.

## Creating CNAME Records

To create CNAME records for your subdomains, you'll use the `cloudflare_record` resource in your Terraform configuration. Here's an example of how to create a CNAME record for the "speedtest" subdomain:

```hcl
resource "cloudflare_record" "speedtest_dns" {
  zone_id = var.cloudflare_zone_id
  name    = var.speedtest_subdomain
  value   = "${var.nuc1_tunnel_uuid}.cfargotunnel.com"
  type    = "CNAME"
  proxied = true
}
```

In this example, the `name` attribute is set to the subdomain variable `var.speedtest_subdomain`, and the `value` attribute is set to the corresponding tunnel UUID `var.nuc1_tunnel_uuid` appended with `.cfargotunnel.com`.

<Callout type="info">
Make sure to define the necessary variables in your `terraform.tfvars` file, such as `cloudflare_zone_id`, `speedtest_subdomain`, and `nuc1_tunnel_uuid`.
</Callout>

## Configuring WWW Redirects

To provide a better user experience, it's recommended to redirect `www` subdomains to their non-www counterparts. You can achieve this using the `cloudflare_page_rule` resource:

```hcl
resource "cloudflare_page_rule" "www_redirect" {
  zone_id  = var.cloudflare_zone_id
  target   = "www.*.${var.cloudflare_zone_name}/*"
  priority = 1
  status   = "active"
  actions {
    forwarding_url {
      status_code = 301
      url         = "https://$1.${var.cloudflare_zone_name}/$2"
    }
  }
}
```

This page rule will redirect any requests to `www.subdomain.example.com` to `subdomain.example.com`, ensuring a consistent URL structure.

## Mapping Subdomains to Tunnel UUIDs

To map your subdomains to the appropriate Cloudflare Tunnel UUIDs, you'll use variables in your Terraform configuration. Here's an example of how to map the "speedtest" subdomain to the tunnel UUID of "nuc1":

```hcl
resource "cloudflare_record" "speedtest_dns" {
  # ...
  value   = "${var.nuc1_tunnel_uuid}.cfargotunnel.com"
  # ...
}
```

<Steps>
### Step 1: Define Tunnel UUID Variables

In your `terraform.tfvars` file, define variables for each tunnel UUID:

```hcl
nuc1_tunnel_uuid = "012345678abcdefg"
nuc2_tunnel_uuid = "..."
```

### Step 2: Use Tunnel UUID Variables in DNS Records

When creating your DNS records, reference the appropriate tunnel UUID variable:

```hcl
resource "cloudflare_record" "subdomain_dns" {
  # ...
  value   = "${var.nuc1_tunnel_uuid}.cfargotunnel.com"
  # ...
}
```

</Steps>

By following this approach, you can easily map subdomains to their corresponding tunnel UUIDs and keep your configuration organized.
